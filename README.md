## Description
**Cajeer Engine** is an open-source content management system (CMS) developed by the Russian team Cajeer 404. The platform is built with PHP and uses MySQL as its primary database management system. Development began in 2013, but from 2018 to 2024 the product was distributed as a commercial solution under the Cajeer Studios Group brand.

In 2025, the system was completely redesigned by a new team of developers and received open-source status. The 2025 release is considered the third major generation of Cajeer Engine.

The developers position the platform as a universal tool for creating websites of any complexity. The main interface languages are English, Spanish, Russian, and French, with additional German and Italian localizations available.

## About the project
**Cajeer Engine** is a content management system developed by the Russian team Cajeer 404 to simplify the creation of custom web resources. The platform is built on PHP and uses MySQL as its primary database, providing convenient administration and the ability to further edit the final product. Development began in 2013, but from 2014 to 2018 the system remained closed and was distributed exclusively through individual client orders. In 2018, the project was transferred to the Cajeer Studios Group, where it received the status of a commercial CMS.

The idea of creating an in-house CMS was proposed by SkiF4er to increase the efficiency of Cajeer 404 developers, simplify subsequent project maintenance, and accelerate the completion of client orders. As a result, the number of web resources built on the system grew significantly, and the CMS became the team’s signature solution. However, as its core components became outdated, the system required major redevelopment and was handed over to Cajeer Studios Group for further improvement. The studio continued enhancing the platform while also changing its license and distribution model, moving away from closed individual deliveries toward a commercial format.

Only the core principle of the platform remained unchanged: “Convenience and simplicity are the key to the CMS’s success.”
